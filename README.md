# AspNetCore - Blog

Developed a Personal Blog in ASP.NET Core 2.1 MVC with Entity Framework Core as a Data Store service. This Blog features like all other blogs with also an Image Optimiization,
In-Memory Cache Page Loading, Authentication and Authorization for only user to access admin panel and so on. The Design of the website is done by leveraging Bootstrap 4.5.2 
Framework from scratch.

This Project is just an Idea of how we can develop a Custom blog with some features related to the other blog websites.
